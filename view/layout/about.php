            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Humphree is a place where people come to buy and sell their stuff.</p>
            <p>We match buyers and sellers, to make it easy to find what you need, and to get rid of what you don't.</p>
            <p>Established in 2017, we are one of the newest market places on the web - what sets us apart are our sophisticated matching algorithms that find you what you want, when you want it. To find an item, simply post a "Wanted" listing and wait for the matches to start rolling in. To sell, post a "For Sale" listing and sit back as potential buyers are notified of what you have.</p>
            <p>Once a match is made, buyer and seller can contact each other via Humphree, and agree on a time and place to make the sale. Meet up, check out the goods and if you're happy, do the deal!</p>
