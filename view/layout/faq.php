                    <h4>How do I buy an item for sale?</h4>
                    To purchase an item you must register as a user and contact the seller directly via the Humphree
                    messaging service.
                    Negotiate with the seller privately and make arrangements to collect the item for sale.

                    <h4>I have something that is listed as wanted. How do I contact the buyer?</h4>
                    To contact a person who has posted a wanted advertisement, you must register as a user and contact
                    the buyer directly via the Humphree private messaging service.
                    Negotiate with the buyer privately and make arrangements to have them collect the item.

                    <h4>Why can’t I pay for my items using Humphree?</h4>
                    Humphree is a free advertising service and does not provide facilities to enable exchange of monies
                    between two parties.
                    All negotiation and exchange of currency is conducted privately between buyer and seller via the
                    Humphree message service. This enables Humphree to provide free advertising space as a service
                    without the overhead of maintaining transactions, and allows Humphree users to maintain more privacy
                    without the need to enter credit card, bank or name and address details.

                    <h4>What does ‘ono’ mean on an advertisement?</h4>
                    ‘Or Near Offer’ - this means that the trader is willing to negotiate and is not necessarily
                    expecting the full advertised price to be paid, but something close to it.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure you are entering your username and password correctly and that caps lock on your
                            keyboard is off.
                        </li>
                        <li>Disable your browser's auto complete feature as it may be filling in incorrect information.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you're using a mobile device, disable predictive text.</li>
                        <li>Clear your browser's cache and cookies.</li>
                    </ul>

                    maximum of 20MB.

                    <h4>How do I message a Seller or Buyer about their ad?</h4>
                    You need to be a registered user and logged on to Humphree. Once you are logged in, click on the
                    advertisement to see the full details of the ad. At the bottom you will see a box where you can type
                    your message to the advertiser. They will reply to your message when they are next logged in to view
                    their messages.

                    <h4>How do I see my messages?</h4>
                    Under My Account, go to the Dashboard and you will find your messages on the Messages tab.

                    <h4>How do I search for an ad?</h4>
                    You can navigate through the advertising categories to find ads or use the Search function from the
                    Home page or the search bar at the top of every page. Simply type in the keywords you are looking
                    for and click on the magnifying glass to begin the search. The search results will return items
                    where any of the words you entered are found. If you would like to search for a phrase, surround
                    the words in double quotes e.g. “Elvis Costello”. If you would like to <em>exclude</em> a word from
                    the search, prefix the word with a minus sign e.g. -book. Keywords must be more than 3 characters.

                    <h4>How do I search on more than just keywords?</h4>
                    You can search on multiple criteria by using the Advanced Search option located on the main search
                    on the home page. In the advanced search you can search for keywords with a category or
                    sub-category, for items on sale or wanted, with a particular condition, the quantity you need and
                    you can search based on a price range.

                    <h4>How is my ad matched to other ads?</h4>
                    When you enter an advertisement, this triggers a search of other advertisements in the same category
                    where the title and description are similar to your advertisement. The price of the other
                    advertisements must be within a 50% variance (up or down) of the price on your own advertisement.
                    Once matches are found, a message is added to your action list so you may view the matched
                    advertisements.

                    <h4>What are Action Items?</h4>
                    Under Action Items you will find a list of advertisements that match your own advertisement. From
                    the Action Items menu, you can view the details of the match, send a message to the advertiser,
                    accept the match, or discard it if it is not what you were looking for.

                    <h4>What happens once I accept a match?</h4>
                    You will see a thumbs up at your side, and the advertiser you are accepting will also see a thumbs
                    up. If they agree to trade with you the will also accept their match and you will see 2 thumbs up in
                    your action list.

                    <h4>Why did I receive an email to give Feedback on my transaction?</h4>
                    If you were provided with a good service and honesty, then it is nice to give the advertiser some
                    positive feedback. The rating will show against their advertisements and help others to know they
                    are a trustworthy source.

                    <h4>What does “Not yet rated” mean?</h4>
                    It means that no-one has provided a rating on this seller yet. Either they are new to Humphree or
                    correspondents have not been kind enough to submit feedback.
